## Welcome!

The web is full of public data that can be easily extracted. On this page I will show you how through my own real-life scraping tasks. If these don't cover your needs, you can [contact me](mailto:hello@scrapeyscrape.com) for bespoke scraping jobs.


### Basic: Scraping reviews from [ratemds.com](ratemds.com)
Recently a friend was considering having back surgery done by Dr. Michael Nikolakis. I wanted to do some research on Dr. Nikolakis and came across ~80 reviews on [ratemds.com](https://www.ratemds.com/doctor-ratings/958209/Dr-Michael-Nikolakis-New+Westminster-BC.html).

The website provides a simple listing of reviews like this:
![ratemds_reviews](./img/ratemds_reviews.jpg)
I wanted to extract the following fields:
- The overall rating in stars;
- Individual ratings for Staff, Punctuality, Helpfulness, and Knowledge;
- The content of the review itself;
- And the date of the review.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/scrapeyscrape/scrapeyscrape.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
